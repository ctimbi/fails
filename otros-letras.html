	<h1>Test cases</h1>
	<h2>Typography</h2>
	<h3>(13) Very small text found</h3>
	<div class="example">
        <p class="small-text">This is some tiny text, much too small for some people to read</p>
    </div>

	<h3>(14) Italics used on long sections of text</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="italic">Italics are sometimes used to highlight text. But you shouldn't use italicized text because they make letters hard to read. The letters have a jagged line compared to non-italic fonts. The letters also lean over making it hard for dyslexic users to make out the words. When the text size is small, the text is even more illegible.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>(15) All caps text found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="all-caps">Typing sentences or phrases IN ALL CAPITALS is rarely a good idea. It may make sense under some circumstances, but only rarely. Lengthy segments of capitalized content are more difficult to read. In some cases, a screen reader may interpret ALL CAPITAL text as being an acronym and may read it as letters rather than words. For example, a screen reader may read the uppercase text CONTACT US as "Contact U. S." because it interprets the uppercase "US" as being an acronym for "United States".</p>
    </div>

    <h3>(16) Justified text found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="justify">When text is justified to both margins it may add additional spaces between words which may be difficult for users with visual or cognitive impairments to read. Full text justification can also cause words to be spaced closely together thus making it difficult to determine where a word starts and ends.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>(17) Inadequate line height used</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="line-height">Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2 allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the previous one.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>(18) Long lines of text</h3>
    <div class="example example--wide">
        <p>For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long lines of text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble keeping their place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters</p>
    </div>

    <h3>(19) Blink element found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <blink>Blinking text and moving text (such as a marquee) can distract the reader's attention. This is especially relevant to people with attention deficits or cognitive disabilities. Neither is likely to cause a seizure, but they are likely to decrease the readability of the document as a whole and increase the time it takes for users to finish reading it.</blink>
    </div>

    <h3>(20) Marquee element found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <marquee>The BLINK and MARQUEE element animates content in a way that cannot be overridden or disabled by the user.</marquee>
    </div>
